Add Codespace support so that users can quickly obtain an environment pre-installed with Sui CLI, along with web-based VS Code and the Move language plugin. Users can start developing immediately without manually installing any tools.

You can try this feature right away:

1.Visit this page: https://github.com/chmod777john/sui-dapp/

2.Press the comma key (,)

3.Follow the instructions to create a Codespace and wait for a moment

4.Once the web-based VS Code interface appears, you can run sui version in the terminal to check if the CLI is installed. Open a Move file to check if the language plugin features (such as syntax highlighting and go-to definition) are ready.
